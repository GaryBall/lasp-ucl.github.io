I earned by BE in Computer & Communication Engineering from the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 2020 and my MSc in Human Robotics from Imperial College London in 2021. I have also completed a research internship within the Systems Group at ETH Zurich in Summer 2019. From January 2022, I joined the LASP Group as a Phd student. My current research interest is the design of reinforcement learning algorithms in such a way that the energy costs remain reasonable while retaining high performance. My goal is to develop novel data-efficient and generalisable learning strategies.
