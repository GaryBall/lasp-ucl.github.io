I graduated from the **American University of Beirut** (Lebanon) in May 2021 with a **Bachelor in Electrical and Computer Engineering** (BEng) with distinction. Along my Bachelor, I also got a **minor in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I joined the **Learning And Signal Processing** (LASP) research group at UCL as a Phd student in October 2021.

I completed an internship at **CYENS Centre of Excellence** (formerly known as RISE) within the Digitally Enhanced Urban Environments (DARE) MRG under the supervision of Dr. Demetris Antoniades from June 2020 to December 2020. The project involved a variety of Data Science processes to clean, tokenize, and extract features from text data and evaluate relationships using a Network Science approach and Graph Neural Networks to do observations over the network connections between the nodes.

I have also worked as a Research Assistant (RA) at the American University of Beirut working in both the Machine Learning lab and the Quantum Computing lab from July 2019 to May 2021.
