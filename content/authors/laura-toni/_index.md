### Bio

Associate Professor at [Electronic & Electrical Departement](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/) at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk)

Director of MSc on Telecommunications and Internet Engineering, and MRes on Telecommunications

[Turing Fellow](https://www.turing.ac.uk/turing-fellows/) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://turing.ac.uk/), the UK National Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.

[ELLIS](https://ellis.eu) (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligient Systems) Member

I graduated from University of Bologna in 2005 (MS degree) and 2009 (PhD degree). I was then a PostDoc for one year at the University of California, San Diego, working with Prof. L. Milstein and Prof. P. Cosman and for three years at the EPFL working with Prof. P. Frossard.
[More about me](https://laspucl2016.wpcomstaging.com/team/laura-toni/bio/).

I am the Principal Investigator at [LASP](https://laspucl2016.wpcomstaging.com/) (Learning And Signal Processing) at the Electronic Engineering Department at [University College London.](https://www.ucl.ac.uk)
My major research contributions are in the area of coding and streaming technologies, machine learning for immersive communications, decision-making strategies under uncertainty, and large-scale signal processing.
