The __Learning And Signal Processing__ is a research lab led by Dr. {{% mention "laura-toni" %}} and is part of the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/electronic-electrical-engineering/ucl-electronic-and-electrical-engineering) at the University College London.

Our research activity focused on developing novel adaptive strategies for large-scale networks with applications including adaptive streaming strategies for virtual reality services, data-efficient multi-arm bandit problems for online recommendation systems, graph-based reinforcement learning for AI systems, and influence maximization over social networks. Our research is at the crossroad between multimedia processing, machine learning, and signal processing.
